<A HREF="prop01/prop1~1.htm">Proposition 1</A>.
	<DD><I>If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut line and each of the segments</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 2"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop02/prop2~1.htm">Proposition 2</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 3"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop03/prop3~1.htm">Proposition 3</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut at random, the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 4"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop04/prop4~1.htm">Proposition 4</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 5"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop05/prop5~1.htm">Proposition 5</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the square on the half</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 6"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop06/prop6~1.htm">Proposition 6</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 7"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop07/prop7~1.htm">Proposition 7</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut at random, the square on the whole and that on one of the segments both together are equal to twice the rectangle contained by the whole and the said segment and the square on the remaining segment</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 8"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop08/prop8~1.htm">Proposition 8</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut at random, four times the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments together with the square on the remaining segment is equal to the square described on the whole and the aforesaid segment as on one straight line</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 9"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop09/prop9~1.htm">Proposition 9</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line between the points of the section</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 10"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop10/prop10~1.htm">Proposition 10</A>.
	<DD><I>If a straight line be bisected, and a straight line be added to it in a straight line, the square on the whole with the added straight line and the square on the added straight line both together are double of the square on the half and of the square described on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line as on the straight line</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 11"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop11/prop11~1.htm">Proposition 11</A>.
	<DD><I>To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 12"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop12/prop12~1.htm">Proposition 12</A>.
	<DD><I>In obtuse-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the obtuse angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular towards the obtuse angle</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 13"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop13/prop13~1.htm">Proposition 13</A>.
	<DD><I>In acute-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides about the acute angle, namely that on which the perpendicular falls, and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular towards the acute angle</I>.<BR>

<A NAME="proposition 14"></A><BR>
<DT>
<A HREF="prop14/prop14~1.htm">Proposition 14</A>.
	<DD><I>To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure</I>.
